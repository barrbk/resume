#### <ins>About Me</ins>
I am a Senior at Appalachian State University majoring in Geography. I have always been interested in the human-environment connection and the ways in which we impact the earth and how the earth impacts us. To further expand my skills in the geography world, I am also planning to graduate with a GIS certificate.
